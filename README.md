Let's start by creating the necessary files and directories for our project. We will need the following:

- `public/index.html`: This will be the main HTML file that users interact with.
- `public/main.js`: This will contain the JavaScript code that powers our app.
- `public/style.css`: This will contain any custom styles for our app.
- `server.js`: This will be our Express server.
- `package.json`: This will contain metadata about our app, including its dependencies.

Here's the code for each file:

public/index.html
